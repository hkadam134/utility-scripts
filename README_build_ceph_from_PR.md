README: WIP Label Integration Script
Overview
This script automates the process of creating a work-in-progress (WIP) development branch for Ceph. It clones the Ceph repository, creates a WIP branch, integrates it with the Ceph-CI repository, and triggers the build process. Once the build is completed, it provides relevant URLs for tracking the build progress.

Features
Validates the provided WIP label to ensure it's a valid directory name.
Clones or updates the Ceph repository.
Checks if a WIP path already exists to prevent conflicts.
Runs the build script for the specified WIP label.
Pushes the branch to the Ceph-CI repository.
Retrieves and displays the relevant Shaman build URL and Ceph-CI commit URL.
Captures the SHA1 for the default build link from Shaman.
Usage
1. Run the script with a WIP label
bash
Copy
Edit
./wip_integration.sh <wip_label>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
./wip_integration.sh wip-hemanth4-testing
2. Display Help
Use the --help or --h flag to see the usage instructions:

bash
Copy
Edit
./wip_integration.sh --help
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have:

Git installed on your system.
Access to the Ceph and Ceph-CI repositories.
Internet connectivity to clone and pull repositories.
How It Works
The script checks for a valid WIP label as input.
It clones or updates the Ceph repository.
Ensures the WIP path does not already exist.
Clones the Ceph repo into the new WIP directory and adds the Ceph-CI remote.
Runs the build-integration-branch script with the provided WIP label.
If successful, it pushes the branch to Ceph-CI and provides:
Shaman Build URL
Ceph-CI Commits URL
Captures the SHA1 from Shaman and displays it.
Output Example
bash
Copy
Edit
Branch name is: wip-hemanth4-testing
Pushing to Ceph-CI...
Shaman URL: https://shaman.ceph.com/builds/ceph/wip-hemanth4-testing/
Ceph-CI Commits URL: https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ci/commits/wip-hemanth4-testing
Captured SHA1 for default link: 57cbff7a79ffb747fdb955fbb0717315c74c7344
Error Handling
If an invalid WIP label is provided, the script exits with an error.
If the WIP path already exists, the script prompts the user to clean up before retrying.
If the build script fails, the process terminates with an appropriate message.
If the SHA1 retrieval from Shaman fails, an error is displayed.
